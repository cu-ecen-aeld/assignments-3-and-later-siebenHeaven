* Start a thread which sleeps @param wait_to_obtain_ms number of milliseconds, then obtains the

* for the thread to complete.
* The start_thread_obtaining_mutex function should use dynamic memory allocation for thread_data
* structure passed into the thread.  The number of threads active should be limited only by the
* amount of available memory.
* The thread started should return a pointer to the thread_data structure when it exits, which can be used
* to free memory as well as to check thread_complete_success for successful exit.
* If a thread was started succesfully @param thread should be filled with the pthread_create thread ID
* coresponding to the thread which was started.
* @return true if the thread could be started, false if a failure occurred.
